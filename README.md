This repository contains a few exercices on Network Analysis with academic purposes.

## Brazilian Air Mesh

The files in :open_file_folder: **MalhaAereaBrasileira** contains exercices relative to the build of a graph dataset with data from brazillian flights.

The dataset is built with public domain data from ANAC about brazilian flights from 2001 up to 2020.
 
A more detailed description is in the Jupyter Notebook's files.

## Chair Wikipedia Network

The files in :open_file_folder: **ChairWikipediaNetwork** contains the build of a directed graph dataset with data from Wikipedia Pages.
The dataset is built based on the citations of each wikipedia's page, were a edge between **A** and **B** means that the page **A** references the page **B** on its article.

In the notebook's example, we're building a network starting at the Chair wikipedia page.
 
You can find a more detailed description is in the Jupyter Notebook's files and or in this Medium Article, where we also describe a few analysis on the network.
